# About

I'm a Boston-based software engineer who specializes in building (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital experiences. Currently, I'm an engineer at Upstatement focused on building accessible, human-centered products.

I'm a developer based in Southern California, I'm interested building applications using web technologies.

Technologies I'm familiar with:

html css pug sass javascript wordpress git docker aws linuxcli

Involved into learning / super excited to learn:

React/React Native

I prepared a little video introducing myself, please watch:

# Projects

NMPG - No Mouse Password Generator

It's a good practice to have different passwords for difference services we sign up for, a lot of us use password generators for it.

I don't like to use the mouse, I will do anything to avoid to take my hands out of the typing position. When comes to password generators there's always a button you have to click somewhere to generate what you want

So I created this app that allows me to generate passwords without having to click on anything, all I have to do is to input a simple syntax that is going to be interpreted by a algorithm and give a password as an output

I think the result was good, maybe once I learn enough react I can try to rewrite using the framework, I even got a domain for it, check it out, there's instructions on the website: nomousepassword.com

What I learn with that project?

I learned to manipulate strings, arrays and to play around with the dom and set shortcuts using event listeners

## project 2

Street fighters II Character selection

that's a fun one! I was practicing some algorithms at codewars.com and i stumble upon one "kata" where I had to simulate the game's selection grid.

Then I thought, can I create a clone of the game selection screen by only using html/css/javascript?

that's what I did, it was a fun way to master how to position elements using css and also how to dynamically change things by manipulating the dom with javascript

you can see the result here: trevzix.com/sf2

## super customizable weather app

This one I did to understand how the fetch api works
I also practiced a lot of dom manipulation trying to make the app as customizable as possible to the user

check that out: trevzix.com/weatherapp

## Fantasy name generator api

Here I was also trying to understand the fetch api, I found a website that offerred a api fatnasy-type names, then I tried to create a interface where I can generate names without having to use the mouse for anything
